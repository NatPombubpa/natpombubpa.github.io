Network analysis showed that Cyanobacteria and Dothideomycetes (Pleosporales) were the major hubs of overall biocrust microbial community. Such hierarchical spatial organization of biocrust communities and their associated biotic networks can have pronounced impacts to ecosystem functions. Our findings provide crucial insights for dryland restoration and sustainable management.","tags":["Biological Soil Crusts","Biocrusts","Fungi","Microbiome","Mycobiome","Mojave
